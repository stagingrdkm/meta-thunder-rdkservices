Subject: ONEM-21606 - Remove incorrect ASSERT
When testing autostart of some plugins, when in negative scenario (plugin did not succeed to start because of timeout),
we noticed that RPC Process shutdown mechanism is based on clock timeouts. It leads to the situation
(especially in case time is adjusted during boot) where TimedInfo is getting rescheduled after time update.
